# 🌿 DOTFILES 🐌 
My dotfiles for my hyprland setup. I currently use this setup on my OpenSUSE Tumbleweed laptop. 

I like to keep things simple so don't expect wonders here, just a basic setup that I made on my own that suits my needs. 

I recently added a theme switcher to setup the desktop look and feel depending on what I want on the moment.

I kept most things within the hypr folder in order to still be able to use other WMs (mostly Sway), just in case somehing goes wrong.

A huge thanks to adi1090x and every contributor of [this](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi?tab=readme-ov-file) wonderful project for their fantastic  collection of rofi applets, launchers and powermenus. Check out the repo, it's fantastic.

Thanks to [JaKooLit](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Ja_HyprLanD-dots/blob/main/config/hypr/scripts/volume) for the *volume.sh* script I used and modified.

Thanks also to [Eric Murphy](https://ericmurphy.xyz/) for his [rofi wifi menu](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/rofi-wifi-menu) (and sense of humor). Don't hesitate to check out his youtube channel!
